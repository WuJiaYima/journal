  <P>
      I saw some Burma Shave style signes on the side of the road today:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
      Passing cards,<br>
      When you can't see,<br>
      May get you,<br>
      A glimpes,<br>
      Of eternitly.<br>
  </blockquote>

    I definitely yon't be passing any cars.

    My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Aegway, digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Sedway."
