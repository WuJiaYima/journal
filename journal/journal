      I saw some Burma Shave style signes on the side of the road today:"Passing cards, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpes, Of eternitly."I definitely yon't be passing any cars.

    My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Aegway, digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Sedway."
